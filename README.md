# sky-remote-web

Web interface for sending remote control commands to a Sky TV box.

The map highlight function did not work on iOS devices after a couple of clicks, so it now has a UI inspired heavily by ui-code's [RemoteControl](https://github.com/ui-code/RemoteControl).

#### Usage

Ensure you have the IP adresses of your Sky boxes in lines 43-44 of `webroot\skyq1.html`.

Access the new UI design at `http://<IP>:29152/skyqq.html`.
